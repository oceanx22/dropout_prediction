# Student Dropout Prediction
This project aims to predict student dropout rates using machine learning techniques. Dropout prediction is crucial in the education sector as it allows institutions to identify students who are at risk of leaving their courses prematurely. By analyzing historical data and building predictive models, this project seeks to help educational institutions take proactive measures to prevent dropouts and provide support to struggling students.

## Project Overview
The main components of the project are as follows:
* Dataset: The dataset used in this project is student-data.csv.
* Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to convert all non-numeric values. 
* Splitting Data: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. In this project, 300 samples of data is used for training the linear regression model, and the remaining 95 samples are used for testing.
* Model Implementation: Models are trained on the training data, We need to train and predict on each classifier for three different data set sizes:100,200 and 300. Hence we expect to get 9 outputs, 3 per model.

## Conclusion
The effectiveness of a student dropout prediction model would depend on various factors such as the accuracy of the data used to train the model, the quality of the features used to make predictions, and the ability to intervene in time to prevent dropouts.
Itâ€™s important to note that while a prediction model can provide valuable insights, it should not be used in isolation as the sole basis for decision-making. Educators and administrators should use the results of the model in conjunction with their professional judgment and other relevant information to make informed decisions about how to support at-risk students.
Overall, a well-designed and well-implemented student dropout prediction model has the potential to positively impact student outcomes and reduce dropout rates.
